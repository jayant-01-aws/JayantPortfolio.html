        Action is about conflict. Whether with guns, blades, fists, or mysterious powers, these manga feature characters in combat - either to protect themselves or the things or people they value, or simply as a way of life. Action Manga is easily the most popular style of manga, both in Japan and around the world. It’s exciting. It’s dynamic. And it’s almost always perfect for a Netflix series or movie, which naturally leads to more sales. But it takes something really special to be on our list of best action manga. You can’t just add POW! in the middle of the sentence and think you have our attention. Equally, you can’t give our heroes skimpy clothing and say, “Job done.” It’s a more refined process than that.

        <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 18px;">There are some manga I prefer reading rather than anime but some of anime are good enough to watch over manga. See the description to find out.</h4>

                    <p>Tokyo Ghoul start with an amazing chapter of Kaneki and Hideyoshi being in coffee shop full of ghouls without knowing. Coming there to see his crush and day everything changed when he decide to test his courage with her. Tokyo Ghoul is an amazing test for you to synthesize to manga. It's good start and healthy scenes (just kidding), nothing healthy in this manga, more gruesome scenes then anime. There are things that changed for anime due to some laws and people's consideration but reading manga gives the original feel of Tokyo Ghoul. But it's worth watching  </p>

                      <p>Once upon a time, a monster in disguise lived in a peaceful little town in a peaceful little valley. The monster cut all ties to evil and began helping the people of the town. But one day, some devilish messengers came to visit. The town was suddenly enveloped in a miasma of fear, and the people began to kill each other.How can a real person become nothing more than fiction? By eliminating everyone who has ever known them, everyone who has ever known of their past—by becoming the only one in the world who knows of their existence.  </p>

                      <p>Berserk is a masterpiece. The word is made for the manga itself. Kentaro Miura lived with knowing that he made an amazing art piece. Berserk has mostly violence element to it, gruesome epitome of devastating scenes. Guts, the OP,  is somewhat can be the most chaotic protogonist you can find. Berserk is yet another boring manga about a boring invincible tough-guy protagonist alternately killing things or brooding about killing things. Everything in the world exists to highlight how "cool" Guts is, with enemies in the middle of a fight pausing to converse with one another about the size of his sword, and onlookers standing around to gossip about how strong he is.</p>

                      <p>Like seeing battle girls...Hmm....Yeah this is for you. It is the Middle Ages, and the remnants of mankind are plagued by paranoia and death. Spoken in fearful whispers, the word “Yoma” cuts a clear image into the minds of all: monstrous beings with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. But fear of their gruesome appetite is dwarfed by that of their ability to shapeshift and steal the memories of their last meal. Forever vulnerable to attack, humans live in unease, even among family. Claymore follows the stoic and low-ranking member Clare in her daunting trek as she searches for personal vengeance. Along the way, she encounters many unexpected things about the world, from the camaraderie and hope held fast by her sisters-in-arms to the sinister truth behind the Claymore Organization.</p>

                      <p>Ever framed for what your friend did...yeah.....It portrays a fictionalized account of the life of Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, based on Eiji Yoshikawa’s novel Musashi. Growing up in the late 16th century Sengoku era Japan, Shinmen Takezō is shunned by the local villagers as a devil child due to his wild and violent nature. Running away from home with a fellow boy at age 17, Takezo joins the Toyotomi army to fight the Tokugawa clan at the Battle of Sekigahara. After the two are separated, Shinmen returns home on a self-appointed mission to notify the Hon’iden family of Matahachi’s survival. He instead finds himself a wanted criminal, framed for his friend’s supposed murder based on his history of violence. Upon being captured, he is strung up on a tree and left to die. An itinerant monk, the distinguished Takuan Soho, takes pity on the “devil child,” secretly freeing Shinmen and christening him with a new name to avoid pursuit by the authorities: Musashi Miyamoto.</p>

                      <p>Man I want Eikichi Onizuka to be my teacher as well. Be a delinquent or a class rowdy, Onizuka sensei will make you a gentalmen with his un-gental-manly-ness. Meet Eikichi Onizuka, a 22-year-old college karate champ and ex-biker. He's crude, foulmouthed, and has a hair-trigger temper. Just the sort of guy you'd expect to see going back to school - to become a teacher. Wanting to switch career from a gangster to a teacher, haha not a great decision one would say but Onizuka with his motivated mind and body will make it possible in naught. With enough comedy and serious element GTO will be in your book-manga-shelf for the eternity. And Watch anime instead....Augggghh I said it..</p>

                      <h3>About</h3>
                      <p>Nothing beats the suspense, thriller and the amount of frenzy you get after reading Attack On Titans. It is set in a fantasy world where humanity lives within territories surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans. The anime follows a group of teenagers living inside cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect the last vestiges of humanity from gigantic humanoid “Titans” that devour people seemingly for no reason. One day, the outer wall is breached by a colossal Titan and thousands died following the attack, including the mother of Eren Yeager, our protagonist. But Heed my advice and watch anime instead and if you're done with anime then feel free to get in manga.</p>

                      <p>I know most of you have already watched the anime but the art Masashi sensei portrays in this manga is on another level. There will be some substance that are different than anime and less censorship. But it's a good read if you wanna experience the art of a mangaka who bought the anime it's name. Naruto being not the only orphan in the village but alone. His childhood wasn't something one would want, he was outcast because he possed the evil Nine-tails (kuruma). As the story proceeds we see Naruto unfolds the power he possess and utilise the power of Nine-tails as well. Saving his friends from pinch and hurting them as well lead to a depression. And ofcourse his friends had to come and save him from that.</p>

                      <p>Even an invincible killer may not be able to survive Hell's Paradise! Gabimaru the Empty, a former ninja assassin known feared as a heartless husk of a man, spends his days on death row wondering when an executioner skilled enough to so much as harm him will arrive, as he thinks nothing of seeing an end to his meaningless existence… Or so he thought. Then the lady executioner, Asaemon the Beheader, rekindles his hope with an astounding proposition. If he ever wishes to see his beloved wife again, he is, under the auspices of the shogunate, to embark on a perilous voyage to the mysterious mystic island said to house the elixir of immortality. Should he be the one among many rival death-row fiends and scoundrels to find the elixir, he’ll earn a full exoneration, and, more importantly, a chance at an ordinary married life with the light of his life–the woman who made the world seem not so ugly. What awaits them is a journey like no other!</p>

                      <p>Orphaned siblings Agni and Luna, like the Ice Witch who cursed their world, are two of the “blessed,” humans who hold special abilities. However, not all who are blessed are friendly, and after another of their kind attacks Agni and decimates the orphans' village, Agni fights to survive, vowing revenge. In the not-too-distant past, the Ice Witch blankets the world in snow, starvation, and madness, leading the inhabitants to seek their salvation in fire. With that, an unusual destiny unfolds for two young orphans, Agni and Luna, blessed with the ability to regenerate. But will this ability prove to be more of a curse than a blessing?</p>
